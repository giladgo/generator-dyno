## Getting Started

### What is Dyno?

Dyno is a Yeoman generator that provides a nice set of defaults for ground-up web development. It scaffolds out a barebones webapp with cool tech:
- [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) (optional, but seriously awesome)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for dependency management
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for running tasks
- [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io/) for keeping things in sync while developing
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) instead of that pesky html
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for styling


### Installation

To install generator-dyno from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-dyno
```

Initiate the generator:

```
$ yo dyno
```

Once everything is ready, start the local server:

```
$ gulp serve
```

If you are ready to deploy the code you have written, run:

```
$ gulp build
```

### Learn more about Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
